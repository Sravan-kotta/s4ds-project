Goal Based Agent Diagram

Goal Based Agent Has a Intentional Approach towards its Goal. i.e 
Goal is already Saved in the Agent.
Hence, the Agent Knows what to achieve as a Goal.
Goal Based Agent Senses the Environment and takes action with respects to its Goal i.e. Action are taken in order to reduce the distance from its Goal.
It has the Knowledge of Environment in its Intentional Knowledge.
Also, it perceives what is happening in the Environment. 
Goal Based Approach is Used By Various Applications. 

The Automatic Cleaners is the Best Sample for Goal Based Agent
The Vacuum Cleaner has the goal of Not having a Single dust Particle in the Mapped Room. 
The Automatic Vacuum Cleaners divides the Room into 100 Squares 
Now, its goal is to Keep Each Square Box Clean.
Hence, the Automatic Vacuum Cleaners will Approach its By Cleaning the Squares Below it. 
This Approach Will Reduce Each Square it travels from The Mapped 100 Squares.

8-3(A) Depth First Search Algorithm is Used Where Some Extensive Computation is Required.
- DFS Uses Very High Memory allocation.
- Also, it Requires to Approach on Stack. Memory/Data Structure
- The Data is Stored and Feth Using Stack Approach.
- Stack Approach refers to "LIFO" "Last In- First Out"
- The DFS is good for Applications where the Goal is Fast Reached 
. Eg- Facial Recognition System.
     - It uses DFS Approach as where the data is Stored in the form of Stack. 
     - The data of All the faces in (cummalative) will be Stored in Stacks.
     - Each time the Person Comes for Facial Recognition the Algorithm Starts Searching the Datasets looking for the Similar faces.
     - The Searching/Sorting Takes Place inside a Stack of datasets acquired
     - The Goal of the Facial Recognition System is to match the Originally captured datasets to the Real time Face displayed with 100% Accuracy.
     - But it cannot achieve the 100% accuracy So, can it achieve 80-90% at max.
     - But the Algorithm tries to Maximize its accuracy Each time it Recognizes the face.
     - The DFS Plays an important Role in order to try and achieve its goal.

Depth First Search Algorithm is Used Whose Some Extensive Computation is Required. 
DFS Uses Very High Memory allocation.
Also, it Requires to Approach on Stack.Memory/Data Structure
The Data is Stored and Feth Using Stack Approach.
Stack Approach refers to "LIFO" "Last In - First Out".
The DFS is good for Applications whose the Goal is Fast Reached

Eg: - Facial Recognition System.
- It uses DFS Approach as where the data is Stored in the form of Stack
- The data of All the faces in (ummalative) will be Stored. in Stacks, 
- Each time the Person Comes for Facial Recognition the Algorithm Starts Searching the Datasets looking for the Similar faces.
- The Searching/Sorting Takes Place inside a Stack of datasets acquired. 
- The Goal of the Facial Recognition System is to match the Originally captured datasets to the Real-time Face displayed with 100% Accuracy.
But it Cannot achieve the 100% accuracy. So, can it achieve 80-90% at max.
- But the Algorithm tries to Maximize its accuracy Each time it Recognizes the face. 
- The DFS Plays an important Role  in order to try and achieve its goal.

Q2. a) Describe Goal-based agent with example.

-> Goal-based agent: 

<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1t9tZ58.jpg"  width="500" height="300">
</div>

. A Goal based agent is a type of agent.
. It is better than simple-reflex and model-reflex agent.
. Goal is very important aspect in life.
. If a person has goal in life, than it can help him/her in decision making at a specific 
moment of time. 
• With the help of Goal, there is saving of time on outliers. 

Now, in AI,
• The agent perceives the environment and it also has past perception saved in memory. 
• The above point is Model - reflex agent, now add a goal for the agent. 
• With the help of experience of past perception and adding Goal clears the path ahead, the agent gets a definite path to the goal.

Let us see an example,
- A Mars lander wants to up the hill. 
- So unlike, Model based reflex agent, now the agent will set a goal to up the hill. so it will set power consumed, fuel usage and the path. So the agent is learning and sets receiving browsed knowledge at every point of time.

- Benefit:
• An agent can learn in the path. 
• It is easy to configure or update any setting as it already has past perception. 

- Issue: 
• Goal is not solution to everything, Goal can be achieved by relying on an easy, scalable path. 
Page No. 6

* There can be multiple paths to goal, 
  so Goal based agent cannot choose the
  correct one, here is where
  Utility agents comes in use.
Q3. 

a) Breadth First Search Algorithm:

- Breadth First Search Algorithm is a 
Un-informed search technique in Artificial 
Intelligence. It is also called as Blind
technique. Reason is that a user can 
explore data upto next stage but after which 
the path is not determined. 

- The Data Structure used in Queue.

- It uses First in First out (FIFO) approach. 
which means that if a state enters the queue 
first, than it'll be the first one to get 
out of queue.

- Shallow Node :
BFM completes the exploring whole node and 
the moves to the next node so it 
appears in the horizontal way of exploring.

- BFM is optimal in nature as the 
is guranteed that his state/node will be 
explored. That's why BFM is complete.
No data is left un explored.
Page No. 8
* Time Complexity of BFM is O(V+E)
Here, V is Vertex.
E is Edge.
* There is no backtracking in this algorithm because Once the node is covered it doesn't enter the queue again. 
Let us see an example: 

[Image of a graph with nodes A, B, C, D, E, F, G. A is the root, B and C are children of A, D is the child of B, E and F are children of C, and G is the child of F.]

Visited : _______
Queue : _______

Now, Let us start with A, so it can be moved to either B or C, let's continue with C, so now in queue it is ACB, if we remove F from queue then we explore node G. So ACBFG. Similarly after removing C from queue we proceed with node B which consists D and E, so-
A ∅ C BFG DE
After B, we move to F, but to F is not further divided into any node.

So the queue looks like:

The above figure shows that all the states are explored with the help of Breadth First Search algorithm.

AI

Q.1) Turing Test approach was an approach made by a renewed scientist Alan Turing.
a. Ans. In this approach, the point of this approach was to show that the robot and human interrogation until the robot comes to know that he is an interogation with another robot.
During this approach there was an interrogation between a robot and a human through computer.
Live human at the place was not necessary because vibration for the robot in front was not required. This approach gave AI a new research to look after.
