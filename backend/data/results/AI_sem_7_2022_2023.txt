i) It should know NLP and able to convent fluent english. 
ii) It show have the knowledge of the world. 
iii) It should be agile to learn and adopt to the dynamic environment 
iv) It should know an machine learing and can easily suspend.
5) Thus, the computer is not allowed our physically present as physical presence

Q.2. 
a. ans) Goal Based Agent

Can I do Now?

How the world is

What can I do now?

Action

Condition Action Rule

(1) The goal based agent acts on the prior knowledge and current action. 
(2) It works on previous knowledge of the agent and takes decision for the goal completion.
(3) Goal based agent set an  for the number of steps to be taken to reach the goal. 
(4) Goal based agent is better suitable for achieving any kind of goal. 
(5) It enhances performance with best suitable for goal oriented task.
(6) It will calculate the risk and steps involved to achieve goal and gives excellent prediction. 
Page No. 5

(7) It will also automatically calculate the distance or steps required.
(8) It has ability to adopt in constantly stochastic environment
(9) It will easily reconfigure for the new percept which it continuously takes from dynamic environment.
(10) The self learning Jarvis are goal based agent. The agent continuously percepts from the environment what happen if the taxi is take sudden left, it will learn how the environment interrelates, signals, traffic etc. an gives the provide directions to reach the goal.
(11) Other example for goal based agent is say, we need to go to Pune from Mumbai, the GPS works and goal based agent it will route and guide the step to reach Mumbai. As there is road blockage or road closure it will reroute. 
So basically, goal based agent gives us best outcomes to reach the goal or to achieve the goal.

For that, the machine / computer has no guess to manipulate or any means to not reveal the identity of machine.
The Turing Test was passed by a chatbot called 'Eugene Bootsman' in 2012.
The interpretor was unable to judge the answer came from computer or human. No physical appearance. 

The Turing Test. 
BFS

1. BFS stands for Breadth First Search.
2. BFS the logic is it starts from root node and visit all the neighboring node till it reach the end node.
3. BFS nodes are in sequence.
4. It has more space complexity.
5. It require more memory.
6. It visits siblings and then children nodes.
7. It is slowest as compared to DFS.
8. No backtracking possible for BFS.
9. It is better for closest node.
10. It is best for shortest nodes.
11. It follow FIFO (First In First Out).

DFS

1. DFS stands for Depth First Search.
2. DFS starts from deepest node and stacks all the node till it reach end node.
3. DFS nodes are stacked form below.
4. It has less space complexity.
5. It require less memory.
6. It visits children node first than sibling node.
7. It is faster compared to BFS.
8. Backtracking is possible for DFS.
9. It is better for far away nodes.
10. It is best for nodes that are far away.
11. It follows LIFO (Last In First Out).
Q.2. a. ans) Goal Based Agent 

[Diagram]

1. The goal based agent acts on the prior knowledge and current action. 
2. It works on previous knowledge of the agent and takes decision for the goal completion.
3. Goal based agent set an  agenda. Agenda for the number of step to be taken to reach the goal.
4. Goal based agent is better suitable for achieving any kind of goal.
5. It enhances performance with best suitable for goal oriented task. 
6. It will calculate the risk and steps involved to achieve goal and gives excellent prediction.

⑦ It will also automatically calculate the distance or steps required.
⑧ It has ability to adopt in constantly stochastic environment
⑨ It will easily reconfigure for the new precept which it continously takes from dynamic environment. 

⑩ The self learning Jarvis are goal based agent. The agent continuously percepts from the environment what happen of the taxi is take sudden left. It will learn how the environment interbalts signals, traffic etc. an gives the precise directions to reach the goal.

⑪ Other example for goal based agents is say, we need to go to Pune from Mumbai, the GPS works and goal based agent it will route and guide the step to reach Mumbai.
As there is road blockage or road closure it will reroute.
So basically, goal based agent gives us best outcomes to reach the goal or to achieve the goal.

a. **Breadth First Search (BFS)**:
1. BFS is finding the shortest Job first.
2. It starts from root nodes, checks the distance from root node to destination node and checks all neighboring nodes.
3. Thus, checking the shortest distance from root node to destination node. It will go to the end node.
4. BFS happens in sequential manner.
5. No Backtracking is possible as it starts from root node.
6. Once the sequence is selected it is possible to delete or alter it later.
7. BFS works best for finding the shortest node.
8. BFS first visits sibling node and then child node.
9. BFS has FIFO concept (First in First out) which makes it suitable for shortest Job.
10. BFS is used in plotting Bipolar Plots and graphs.

Example of BFS

The root node is S
The destination node is g

The BFS will first check all the neighbouring nodes and then decide the shortest Id node. 

Root Node
 
Thus, the BFS would select the closest path from Rootnode s to g
that is it will select, 
s --> D --> g.

Q(1)a)
Ans). Turing Test Approach
(1) The Turing Test was designed by Alan Turing in the year 1950.
(2) Turing Test was designed in such a way that computer identity would not be revealed to the interruptor
(3) The Turing Test had an interpretator who's task is to recognize which answer was given by machine and human.
(4) The machine/computer prerequisites are:-
    (i) It should know NLP and able to convent fluent English.
    (ii) It should have the knowledge of the world.
    (iii) It should be agile to learn and adopt to the dynamic environment
    (iv) It should know an machine learning and can easily respond.
(5) Thus, the computer is not allowed our physically present as physical presence

$\implies$ Example of BFS


The root node is S
The destination node is Y

The BFS will first check all the neighbouring nodes and then decide the shortest node.
Root Node

Thus, the BFS would select the closest path from Root node S to Y that is it will select,
S $\implies$ D $\implies$ Y.
